== Setup Qt Creator ==

  * Install all the above mentioned software.
  * Open up Qt Creator
  * Go to _Tools > Options > Version Control > Subversion_
  * Specify the install location of your svn client (svn.exe)
    * For example: _C:\Program Files\SlikSvn\bin\svn.exe_
  * Fill out the authentication field
    * Your username is your G-mail address
    * Your password can be found at  _https://code.google.com/hosting/settings_
  * Confirm your settings with _OK_

  * Now press the _Create Project_ button
  * Select _Project from Version Control_
  * In the right screen select _Subversion Checkout_
  * Press _Choose_
  * Specify the address of the repository field _( https://stereo-vision-client.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ )_
  * Specify the folder where your working copy should be stored in _Checkout path_
 * Leave the _Checkout directory_ field unchanged
 * Press _next_
 * You might be asked for some building parameters, just click next/ok
   * It's also possible that you will get a warning about a user file, it will ask if you want to discard it, which is a good idea, because it's my Ubuntu user file.
